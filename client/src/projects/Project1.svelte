  <p>In the realm of software development, having a personal portfolio website is more than just a digital business card. It's a platform to showcase your projects, skills, and professional experiences - an interactive resume, if you will. Today, I am going to delve into the process of building my own portfolio website using a modern full-stack development framework: Svelte and Actix.</p>
  <h3 id="front-end-svelte">Front-End: Svelte</h3>
  <p>Firstly, the front-end of the website is built using Svelte, a lightweight, efficient, and reactive JavaScript framework. Svelte, unlike traditional JavaScript frameworks that do most of the heavy lifting in the browser, compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JavaScript. This approach provides superior loading and runtime performance and a reactive programming model that eliminates the need for a virtual DOM.</p>
  <p>I chose Svelte because it allows me to write less code and it's highly expressive. It’s also very efficient, which means my website will load faster and be more responsive. Svelte allows me to write components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then compiles these components into highly efficient imperative code that directly manipulates the DOM.</p>
  <h3 id="back-end-actix">Back-End: Actix</h3>
  <p>For the back-end, I employed Actix, a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast Rust-based web framework. Actix is known for its performance and type safety. It uses the Actor model, which means each Actor runs in its own thread and communicates with others via messages. This design allows for high concurrency and high scalability, making it a strong choice for web servers.</p>
  <p>I chose Actix because it offers unparalleled performance and reliability. Rust’s emphasis on memory safety and zero-cost abstractions means that I can be confident that my server code is safe from common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races. Plus, the type system in Rust ensures that many other types of bugs get caught at compile time, allowing me to deliver a more stable and bug-free website.</p>
  <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Combining the power of Svelte and Actix, I developed a personal portfolio website that is not only efficient and reliable, but also an effective platform to exhibit my work. This full-stack portfolio website represents a culmination of various projects, skills, and professional experiences, offering a comprehensive view of my capabilities to prospective employers.</p>
  <p>The journey of creating this portfolio site has been a rewarding one. It was a fantastic opportunity to deep-dive into these modern frameworks and experience their potential firsthand. As I continue my software development journey, I look forward to incorporating these tools in future projects and exploring more such powerful technologies.</p>
